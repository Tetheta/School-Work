Class work from my time at Walla Walla University

NOTE: If you're curious about the Mobile Game I'm currently developing in Unity (or rather, the details and code), please send me a message! I don't have it on public viewing for security reasons, but I'd be happy to send you a build and some of the code. I can port it to all computers and most mobile devices. 

I'm experimenting with a WebGL version of the game right now so people who visit my github can play. Controls are WASD, click to shoot, but it's not exactly optimized for the computer. Also don't hit the stop button, my menu has iOS specific stuff in it so I had to take it out for this build. Build can be found here, let me know if you have any issues by emailing travis.crumley@gmail.com
