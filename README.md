School-Work
===========

Class work from my time at Walla Walla University

NOTE: If you're curious about the Mobile Game I'm currently developing in Unity, please send me a message! I don't have it on public viewing for security reasons, but I'd be happy to send you a build and some of the code. I can port it to all computers and most mobile devices. 

A current test build can be seen here (WASD to move, tap to shoot). Not everything will work properly however, since our backend is linked only to the iOS build at the moment.
