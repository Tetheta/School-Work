School-Work
===========

Class work from my time at Walla Walla University

NOTE: If you're curious about the Mobile Game I'm currently developing in Unity, please send me a message! I don't have it on public viewing for security reasons, but I'd be happy to send you a build and some of the code. I can port it to all computers and most mobile devices. 

Unfortunately I can't currently export to webplayer from Unity 5 without causing odd errors that a number of other people are also having. If you'd like to see my game in action please contact me on here or at traviscrumley@gmail.com and I can send you what I currently have. Hopefully the web player will start working again soon.
